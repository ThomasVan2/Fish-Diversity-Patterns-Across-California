# Fish Diversity Patterns Across California

* This map showcases the distribution of fish diversity in California's watersheds, highlighting areas with the richest aquatic life. 
* Bright yellows mark regions of high diversity, particularly in the ecologically vibrant San Pablo Bay and along the coast where riverine meets marine ecosystems, such as the Klamath. 
* Coastal proximity is shown to be a key factor, with these areas displaying a wider array of species. 
* This visualization not only serves as a tool for ecological insight but also aids in identifying key areas for conservation focus.
